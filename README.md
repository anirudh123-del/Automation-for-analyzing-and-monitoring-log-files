# Log Analysis and Monitoring Script

This script is designed to automate the analysis and monitoring of log files. It continuously monitors a specified log file for new entries, looks for specific keywords, and logs occurrences of those keywords.

## Usage

### Requirements

- Python 3.x

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone <https://github.com/anirudh123-del/Automation-for-analyzing-and-monitoring-log-files>
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
    cd log-analysis-script
    ```

3. Ensure Python 3.x is installed. You can check the version by running:

    ```
    python --version
    ```

### Running the Script

1. Replace `"your_log_file.log"` in the script with the path to the log file you want to monitor.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the script using Python:

    ```
    python log_monitor.py
    ```

4. The script will start monitoring the specified log file. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the monitoring process.

## Testing

To test the script, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a sample log file or use an existing one for testing purposes.

2. Add some log entries containing the keywords specified in the script (e.g., "ERROR", "HTTP").

3. Run the script and observe if it detects and logs occurrences of the specified keywords.

4. Interrupt the script using `Ctrl+C` to ensure it handles interruptions gracefully.
